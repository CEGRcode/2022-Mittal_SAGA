All composites used in the paper were bundled into `Composite Plot Data 221019.xlsx` for user convenience.

This directory contains the scripts for organizing the `03_Bulk_Processing` output data and grouping it by figures from the paper. After generating composites in bulk from `03_Bulk_Processing`, run `make_subfigures.sh` to save composites in figure/subfigure-specific directories.
